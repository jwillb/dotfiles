# dotfiles
A repository for my dotfiles, along with a script to copy them.
To copy dotfiles to the repo initially, first put your repo path into each of the two scripts. Then, add your dotfiles' relative paths (from your home directory) to files.txt
Then, run copy_to_repo.sh to copy your dotfiles here. Finally, run symlink.sh to link your files.
